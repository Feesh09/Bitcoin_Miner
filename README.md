Bitcoin Miner. This game was made so people could play games even if your school blockedall the game sites.
I looked at games I can make and games I play the most and clicker games was at the top. I hope this game works but who knows.
Code.org and Github were used to make this game. "howimade" is what it took to make the game.
This game has 10 codes, 9 miners, 1 ultra miner, soundtrack, click upgrades, auto miner, auto miner upgrades, and a currency changer.
When I finished the game it didnt work that well, but after a little bit of trouble shooting it all worked fine.
In the end I am happy with the results. I will be posting the game and information on Instagram soon.
